# ledcontrolrasp
Expand client application with activity to control user output device (e.g. LED display).
(a) The interface should allow setting the state of all available user outputs (e.g. the LED matrix
from the Sense Hat add-on). The interface should clearly communicate whether the current
user settings correspond to the output states (i.e. whether the user has applied the last
changes). Use previously prepared graphic interface prototype designs.
(b) The application should send a request to the server containing control commands. Use an
adequate HTTP method.
(c) Run and test app on a physical or virtual mobile device. Make sure the network communication is working properly. You can use a physical or virtual embedded device for testing, or
a server mock in the form of a local CGI script saving control commands to text le.
